# MLMC

## C++ European and path-dependent options pricing 

### Objectives:

- Implementation of closed-form formulas with different discretization schemes
- Implementation of standard Monte Carlo and Brownian Bridge method for barrier options under both BS and Heston model
- Implementation of Multi Level Monte Carlo and antithetic MLMC
- Comparison of results in terms of variance reduction and time complexity

### Results:

- Variance reduction for MC with Brownian Bridge method vs standard MC
- Variance reduction for MLMC vs MC

### Output overview
